When I watch Jeopardy, I want to know how many questions I would get right and what my potential score might be. This Android App will enable me to enter responses for each question as the game is played on TV. Then I'll be able to see how many questions I got right and what my score would be (assuming I won all buzzer races of course). 

This project is still in the development phase and is not fully functional yet. There is some basic functionality but all the statistics, scores, and aesthetics are not complete.
